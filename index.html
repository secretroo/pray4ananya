                    Ananya was once a happy-go-luck girl who enjoyed life to the fullest. Then on a fateful day she decided to take admission into the last circle of hell, also known as VIT Chennai. She had made a decision to endure hell, a prison under the guise of an educational institute. Being the warrior she is, she has been enduring it without complains and today we  shall pray for her soul to help her endure three more years of this punishment.
